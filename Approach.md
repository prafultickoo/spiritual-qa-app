This document outlines the approach to create a web app aimed at being a personal spiritual guru for everyone. 
We will first scrape data which will act as our source of wisdom. 
This data will be stored in a vector database from where users can get answers to their questions.
The app will have a chat interface where users can ask questions and get answers.   
In next phase, we will build a feature where the system can adapt answers to different personality traits. 
The system will learn from user interactions and adapt its responses accordingly.
All the documents are stored in the Documents folder. 
We will use agentic AI approach to code the app 
We will use CrewAI framework to build the app
We will write modular code and use proper version control 
Modules:
1. Document Reader
2. Document Chunking
3. Store chunks in Vector Database
4. Chat Interface
5. Personality Adaptation
We will use Reinforcement Learning to train the system to adapt to different personality traits.
We will use various models as per user's choice to generate responses.
We will use ChromaDB as our vector database.
We will use CrewAI for creating agents
We will use Langchain for building user defined tools
