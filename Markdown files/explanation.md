# Spiritual Guide App - Implementation Explanation

## Project Overview
We're building a Spiritual Guide application that can read and process spiritual texts (including those with Sanskrit verses), store them in a vector database, and answer user queries using various LLM models. The system is designed with an agentic approach using the CrewAI framework.

## Latest Updates - Port Mismatch Fix & Unified Startup (Aug 18, 2025)

- Refactored `start_app.py` to allocate dynamic ports using `utils/network_utils.find_free_port()` and to start the backend with Uvicorn from `api/` (`spiritual_api:app`).
- Created `utils/app_launcher_utils.py` with `write_frontend_config()` to generate `frontend/config.js` each run, pointing to the correct backend URL. One function, one task.
- Frontend now always reads the correct backend URL from `frontend/config.js`, eliminating port mismatch.
- Recommended startup: run `start_app.py` (or `launch_app.py`). Avoid opening `frontend/index.html` directly without the launcher.
- GPT-5 remains fully supported end-to-end: listed in `/models`, selectable in the frontend, handled in `LLM_MODELS['gpt-5']` with `max_completion_tokens`.

How to run
```bash
python start_app.py
```

Quick verification
- App opens in browser; settings panel shows GPT-5 option.
- Backend health: check logs for GET `/health` status ok.
- Models: GET `/models` includes `gpt-5`.
- Ask: select GPT-5 and ask a question; expect answer + sources.

## Latest Updates - Centralized LLM Timeout (Aug 20, 2025)

- Implemented centralized timeout wrappers in `utils/llm_timeout.py`:
  - `call_chat_completion_with_timeout()` for synchronous calls
  - `call_chat_completion_with_async_timeout()` for async calls
- Refactored `utils/query_classifier.py` to use the sync wrapper for intent classification.
- Refactored `utils/llm_integrations.py` to use the async wrapper for response generation.
- Added `LLM_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` to `.env.template` (default 30 seconds).
- All LLM calls now carry a `request_id` for improved logging and diagnostics.

How to configure
- Set `LLM_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` in your `.env` to control max wait time (seconds).
- The wrappers raise `TimeoutError` on timeouts; callers handle this gracefully with fallbacks.
- Always route new OpenAI chat completion calls through these wrappers to prevent hangs.

### Testing the timeout wrappers
- Unit-style tests were added in `tests/test_llm_timeout_wrappers.py` using a fake client (no network calls).
- To run just these tests:

```bash
pytest -q tests/test_llm_timeout_wrappers.py
```

- Expected: slow fakes raise `TimeoutError`; fast fakes succeed and return a minimal response object.

## Frontend Update - GPT-5 Temporarily Disabled (Aug 20, 2025)

- Change: The `GPT-5` option in the model selector (`frontend/index.html`) is now disabled.
- Reason: Temporary pause due to performance/investigation needs.
- Default remains: `GPT-4.1`.
- How to re-enable: Remove the `disabled` attribute from the GPT-5 `<option>` in `frontend/index.html`.

## Latest Updates - GPT-5 Integration (August 16, 2025)

### üöÄ GPT-5 Successfully Integrated as Default Model
**Complete integration with GPT-5 as the primary AI model:**

**Frontend Changes:**
- Added GPT-5 option to model dropdown with ‚≠ê indicator
- Set GPT-5 as default selected option in HTML (`selected` attribute)
- Updated JavaScript settings to use 'gpt-5' as default model

**Backend API Changes:**
- Updated `spiritual_api.py` default model to "gpt-5"
- Added GPT-5 to `LLM_MODELS` configuration with proper parameters
- Updated parameter handling logic for GPT-5's requirements

**Answer Generator Updates:**
- Updated all default model parameters to "gpt-5"
- Added special GPT-5 handling in `_create_llm_completion()` method
- Fixed parameter structure: uses `max_completion_tokens`, no `temperature` support

**Key GPT-5 API Requirements Discovered:**
- ‚úÖ Uses `max_completion_tokens` instead of `max_tokens`
- ‚úÖ Does not support custom `temperature` (uses default value 1)
- ‚úÖ Supports standard optional parameters (`top_p`, `frequency_penalty`, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Same message format as GPT-4

**Testing Results:**
- ‚úÖ API integration successful 
- ‚úÖ High-quality spiritual responses with Sanskrit quotes
- ‚úÖ Frontend dropdown working correctly
- ‚úÖ End-to-end integration verified

**Performance Investigation & Optimization:**
After testing, discovered GPT-5 has significant performance issues with RAG contexts:
- **Direct GPT-5 API call**: 3.36 seconds (fast)
- **GPT-5 with RAG context**: 40-70+ seconds (extremely slow)
- **GPT-4.1 with same RAG context**: 7-8 seconds (normal)

**Root Cause**: GPT-5 becomes extremely slow when processing large spiritual text contexts from the RAG pipeline, making it impractical for real-time use.

**Solution Applied:**
- Reverted default model back to GPT-4.1 for optimal user experience
- Kept GPT-5 available as optional choice with "(Slower)" warning
- Added context optimization for GPT-5 (reduced chunks from 5 to 3)
- GPT-5 remains fully functional but with performance trade-offs

## UI Improvements

### Sanskrit Test Removal
- Removed the Sanskrit rendering test that appeared when launching the app
- The chat interface now starts clean without any test content
- Provides a more professional user experience

### Context-Aware Follow-up Queries Fix (Latest)
- **Issue**: Follow-up queries like "Explain in bullet points please" were returning unrelated answers
- **Root Cause**: Frontend was not sending conversation history to the backend API
- **Solution**: Updated frontend `callSpiritualAPI()` to include conversation history in the payload
- **Implementation**: Conversation history is now properly formatted with alternating user/assistant messages
- **Result**: Context-aware follow-up queries now work correctly, enabling true conversational AI

## Current Implementation Status

```

### 2. Document Loading Implementation
We've implemented a document loading system using the following components:

- **utils/document_utils.py**: Core utility functions for:
  - Loading PDF documents and extracting text
  - Processing documents from a directory
  - Preserving verse structure
  - Extracting document metadata

This utility handles loading and processing of PDF documents, particularly spiritual texts that include Sanskrit verses. It ensures verse structure is preserved during text extraction.

### 3. Document Chunking System
We've created a chunking system that preserves verse integrity:

- **utils/chunking_utils.py**: Specialized functions for:
  - Splitting text into meaningful chunks
  - Ensuring verse integrity across chunk boundaries
  - Identifying and extracting verses
  - Formatting chunks for vectorization

The chunking system is designed to respect verse boundaries and maintain context, which is critical for spiritual texts that include Sanskrit verses and commentaries.

### 4. Agentic Approach with CrewAI
We've implemented an agentic approach using CrewAI framework with two specialized agents:

#### Agent 1: Document Chunking Expert
- Defined in **agents/document_agents.yaml**
- Role: Process documents and create high-quality chunks
- Preserves verse structure and maintains context
- Uses specific prompts from **prompts/document_prompts.py**

#### Agent 2: Document Chunk Quality Verifier
- Defined in **agents/document_agents.yaml**
- Role: Verify chunk quality and integrity
- Ensures verses aren't split and context is maintained
- Provides feedback on chunk quality

#### Task Definitions
- **tasks/document_tasks.yaml**: Defines specific tasks for each agent
- Tasks are sequenced to first create chunks and then verify them

### 5. Main Processor Implementation
We've created **document_processor.py** that:
- Loads agent and task configurations from YAML

### 8. Environment Configuration
We've created a template for environment variables in **.env.template**:
- API keys for various LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Vector database configuration
- Other settings for the application

### 9. Langchain Integration
We've refactored the document processing system to leverage Langchain's powerful document handling capabilities:

#### Langchain Utilities (langchain_utils.py)
- **Document Loading**: Using `PyPDFDirectoryLoader` for more efficient PDF loading
- **Document Chunking**: Implementing `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` with custom logic to preserve verse integrity
- **Verse Identification**: Enhanced verse detection using regex patterns
- **Metadata Handling**: Better metadata extraction and preservation

```python
def load_documents(directory_path: str) -> List[Document]:
    """Load all PDF documents from a directory using Langchain"""
    # Use Langchain's PyPDFDirectoryLoader to load all PDFs in the directory
    loader = PyPDFDirectoryLoader(directory_path)
    documents = loader.load()
    return documents

def chunk_documents(documents: List[Document], chunk_size: int = 1500, 
                   chunk_overlap: int = 200, preserve_verses: bool = True) -> List[DocumentChunk]:
    """Create chunks from documents using Langchain text splitters"""
    # Initialize text splitter with custom parameters
    text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
        chunk_size=chunk_size,
        chunk_overlap=chunk_overlap,
        separators=["\n\n", "\n", " ", ""]
    )
    
    # Split documents while preserving verse structure
    chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
    
    # Process chunks to identify verses and create DocumentChunk objects
    document_chunks = []
    for chunk in chunks:
        verses = identify_verses(chunk.page_content) if preserve_verses else []
        document_chunks.append(DocumentChunk(
            content=chunk.page_content,
            metadata=chunk.metadata,
            verses=verses,
            has_verses=bool(verses)
        ))
    
    return document_chunks
```

### 10. Agent Tools Implementation
We've implemented specialized tools for CrewAI agents using the Langchain utilities:

#### Agent Tools (agent_tools.py)
- **document_loader**: Tool for loading documents using Langchain
- **document_chunker**: Tool for creating chunks while preserving verse integrity
- **chunk_verifier**: Tool for verifying chunk quality and detecting issues
- **chunk_saver**: Tool for saving processed chunks to disk

```python
# CrewAI Tool objects
document_loader = Tool(
    name="document_loader",
    description="Load PDF documents from a directory using Langchain",
    func=document_loader_tool
)

document_chunker = Tool(
    name="document_chunker",
    description="Split documents into chunks while preserving verse structure",
    func=document_chunker_tool
)

chunk_verifier = Tool(
    name="chunk_verifier",
    description="Verify chunk quality and integrity, especially for verses",
    func=chunk_verifier_tool
)

chunk_saver = Tool(
    name="chunk_saver",
    description="Save processed chunks to a JSON file",
    func=save_chunks_tool
)
```

These tools are used by our CrewAI agents to perform document loading, chunking, and verification tasks while preserving verse integrity and maintaining high quality chunks.

### 11. PDF Orientation Detection and Correction

We've implemented specialized tools to handle rotated or improperly oriented PDF documents:

#### PDF Orientation Utilities (pdf_orientation_tools.py)
- **Orientation Analysis**: Detects if PDFs have rotation/orientation issues
- **Rotation Correction**: Applies appropriate rotation to fix orientation
- **OCR Processing**: Falls back to OCR for problematic documents
- **Smart Detection**: Uses text pattern analysis and OCR confidence to determine best orientation

```python
def analyze_pdf_orientation(pdf_path: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Analyzes a PDF to detect if it has orientation/rotation issues"""
    # Analysis logic to detect rotation issues
    # Returns detailed analysis with pages needing correction
    
def correct_pdf_orientation(pdf_path: str, output_path: str = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Corrects orientation issues in a PDF, saving the corrected version"""
    # Uses either rotation correction or OCR depending on the document type
    # Returns results with path to corrected document
```

#### Agent Tools for PDF Orientation (pdf_orientation_agent_tools.py)
- **pdf_orientation_analyzer**: Tool for detecting PDF orientation issues
- **pdf_orientation_corrector**: Tool for correcting rotation problems
- **pdf_ocr_processor**: Tool for applying OCR with orientation correction
- **batch_pdf_analyzer**: Tool for analyzing multiple PDFs in a directory

```python
# CrewAI Tool objects
pdf_orientation_analyzer = Tool(
    name="pdf_orientation_analyzer",
    description="Analyze PDF documents for orientation/rotation issues",
    func=pdf_orientation_analyzer_tool
)

pdf_orientation_corrector = Tool(
    name="pdf_orientation_corrector",
    description="Correct orientation/rotation issues in PDF documents",
    func=pdf_orientation_corrector_tool
)
```

These tools enable our agents to intelligently handle rotated or improperly scanned documents, ensuring that text extraction works correctly even with problematic PDFs. This improves the robustness of our document processing pipeline.

### 12. Document Vectorization

We've implemented a document vectorization system to convert text chunks into vector embeddings for efficient retrieval:

#### Vectorization Utilities (vectorization_utils.py)
- **DocumentVectorizer**: Core class for vectorizing document chunks and storing them in ChromaDB
- **Embedding Model Support**: Integration with both OpenAI and HuggingFace embedding models
- **Persistent Vector Storage**: Ensures vector databases are stored on disk for later retrieval
- **Metadata Preservation**: Maintains all document and verse metadata during vectorization

```python
def vectorize_chunks(self, chunks: List[DocumentChunk], batch_size: int = 32) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Vectorize document chunks and store them in the vector database."""
    # Convert chunks to Langchain Document objects with metadata
    documents = self._convert_chunks_to_documents(chunks)
    
    # Initialize or load existing Chroma DB
    # Store vectors persistently on disk
    # Return vectorization results
```

#### Vectorization Agent Tools (vectorization_agent_tools.py)
- **vectorize_chunks**: Tool to vectorize DocumentChunk objects directly

- Specialized in converting spiritual text chunks into high-quality embeddings
- Uses GPT-4.1 model with temperature 0 for consistent, high-quality results

### 13. Query Processing and Retrieval

We've implemented a query processing system to handle user queries and retrieve relevant document chunks:

#### Query Processing Utilities (query_utils.py)
- **QueryProcessor**: Core class for processing queries and retrieving relevant chunks
- **Embedding Consistency**: Uses the same embedding models as document vectorization
- **Multiple Retrieval Methods**: Supports both standard similarity search and MMR

```python
def process_query(self, query_text: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Process a user query and convert to embeddings"""
    # Create embedding for the query using the same model that created the document embeddings
    query_embedding = self.embedding_model.embed_query(query_text)
    # Return query information and embedding

def retrieve_relevant_chunks(self, query_text: str, k: int = 5) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Retrieve relevant document chunks for a user query"""
    # Use vector similarity search to find relevant documents
    relevant_docs = self.vector_store.similarity_search(query_text, k=k)
    # Format and return results
```

#### Query Agent Tools (query_agent_tools.py)
- **process_query**: Tool to convert user queries into embeddings
- **retrieve_chunks**: Tool for standard similarity-based retrieval
- **retrieve_diverse_chunks**: Tool for MMR-based retrieval that balances relevance and diversity

#### Query Processing Agent (document_agents.yaml)
- Agent role: "Spiritual Document Retrieval Expert"
- Specialized in understanding and processing spiritual queries
- Uses GPT-4.1 model with max tokens 8096 to handle complex queries

## Approach to Verse Preservation
A key focus of our implementation is preserving Sanskrit and English verses during document processing:

1. **Verse Identification**: Using regex patterns to identify verse structures
2. **Preventing Splits**: Ensuring verses aren't split across chunk boundaries
3. **Context Preservation**: Maintaining surrounding context with verses
4. **Quality Verification**: Using a dedicated agent to verify verse integrity

## Next Steps
According to our plan, the next steps will be:

1. Complete testing of the agentic document loading system
2. Implement document vectorization and store in ChromaDB
3. Create retrieval system for relevant chunks based on queries
4. Implement LLM integration for the various supported models
5. Develop the API and frontend components

## Implementation Details

### Verse Preservation Logic
```python
def ensure_verse_integrity(chunks, verse_pattern):
    """Ensures verses aren't split across chunks."""
    # Algorithm for preserving verses across chunks
    # Identifies verses near chunk boundaries
    # Merges chunks if necessary to preserve verses
    # Returns chunks with intact verses
```

### Agentic Framework Integration
The agentic approach leverages CrewAI's framework to:
1. Load documents using specialized tools
2. Process text while preserving verse integrity
3. Verify chunk quality through a dedicated agent
4. Store processed chunks for vectorization

This approach ensures high-quality document processing that respects the integrity of spiritual texts and their verse structure.

## Step 16: LLM Contextual Query Enhancement (IN PROGRESS)

### Overview
Implementing a sophisticated multi-stage pipeline to handle follow-up questions intelligently, enhancing ambiguous queries with conversation context while minimizing unnecessary LLM API calls.

### Stage 1: Fast Heuristic Detection (COMPLETED)
**File: `utils/conversation_context.py`**

Implemented pattern-based detection for follow-up queries:
- **Pronoun Detection**: Identifies "this", "that", "it", "these", etc.
- **Reference Detection**: Spots "the same", "similar", "more about"
- **Fragment Detection**: Catches incomplete sentences
- **Conversational Patterns**: Recognizes follow-up indicators

```python
class ConversationContextProcessor:
    def is_follow_up_query(query: str) -> bool:
        # Fast pattern matching without LLM calls
        # Returns True if query appears to be a follow-up
```

### Stage 2: Semantic Analysis (COMPLETED)
**File: `utils/semantic_analyzer.py`**

Deeper analysis for ambiguous queries using SpaCy NLP:
- **Pronoun Resolution**: Maps pronouns to potential antecedents
- **Topic Extraction**: Identifies key concepts from conversation
- **Ambiguity Detection**: Measures query specificity
- **Semantic Overlap**: Compares with previous exchanges

```python
class SemanticAnalyzer:
    def analyze_ambiguity(query, conversation_history):
        # NLP-based analysis without LLM
        # Returns detailed ambiguity assessment
```

### Stage 3: LLM-Powered Intent Classification (COMPLETED)
**File: `utils/query_classifier.py`**

Sophisticated LLM-based classification using multi-shot learning:
- **Intent Types**: reformatting, perspective_application, content_modification, information_expansion, etc.
- **Action Routing**: Determines whether to use RAG, reformat previous, or apply new perspective
- **Enhancement Decision**: Identifies if query needs context injection
- **Explainable AI**: Provides reasoning for each classification

```python
class LLMQueryClassifier:
    def classify_query_intent(query, conversation_history, llm_client):
        # Multi-shot LLM classification
        # Returns: {intent, action, needs_rag, enhancement_needed, explanation}
```

### Multi-Shot Examples Include:
1. **Reformatting**: "Summarize this in 3 bullets"
2. **Perspective Shift**: "Give corporate examples"
3. **Content Modification**: "Explain without Sanskrit"
4. **Information Expansion**: "Tell me more about this"
5. **Comparison**: "How is this different from Buddhism?"
6. **Application**: "How can I practice this daily?"

### Key Design Decisions:

1. **Staged Pipeline**: Only calls expensive LLM when necessary
2. **Rollback Safety**: Git tags at each stage for easy reversion
3. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive tests for each stage
4. **User Control**: Uses same LLM model as selected by user
5. **Token Efficiency**: Uses full token allowance for quality

### Testing Results:
- ‚úÖ Stage 1: All heuristic patterns correctly detected
- ‚úÖ Stage 2: Semantic analysis accurately identifies ambiguity
- ‚úÖ Stage 3: 100% classification accuracy on test scenarios

### Next Steps:
1. Integrate all stages into EnhancedDocumentRetriever
2. Add query enhancement logic for ambiguous queries
3. Implement action routing based on classification
4. Add comprehensive error handling
5. Put behind feature flag for safe rollout
