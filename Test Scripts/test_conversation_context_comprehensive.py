Comprehensive test script to verify conversation context functionality.

Tests both normal questions and follow-up questions to ensure:
1. Normal questions work as expected
2. Follow-up questions properly use conversation history
3. Context enhancement actions work (reformat_previous, clarify_previous)

It means you do your work sincerely, but you let go of worrying about what you will get in return. You offer your actions to something higher than yourself, like the Divine or the greater good. This practice helps purify your mind and eventually leads to spiritual liberation. The key is to act with love and dedication while remaining unattached to success or failure."),
        
        ("Give me more details about this", True, "User: What is meditation?\nAssistant: Meditation is a practice of training your mind to focus and achieve a state of peaceful awareness. It involves sitting quietly, usually with closed eyes, and directing your attention inward. Through meditation, you learn to observe your thoughts without getting caught up in them, cultivating inner stillness and clarity. Regular practice helps reduce stress, increase self-awareness, and connect you with your true nature."),

It represents the moral and ethical principles that guide right living. Dharma is not the same for everyone - a teacher's dharma differs from a soldier's or a parent's. Following your dharma means acting in harmony with your true nature while contributing to the greater good of society and the universe."),
