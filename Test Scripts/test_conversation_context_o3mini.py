        ("Convert this to a numbered list", True, 
         "User: What is moksha?\nAssistant: Moksha is the ultimate spiritual liberation in Hindu philosophy. It represents the soul's release from the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth (samsara). When you achieve moksha, you realize your true divine nature and unite with the infinite consciousness (Brahman). It's the end of all suffering and the beginning of eternal bliss and knowledge.",

        # 4. Follow-up: Ask for practical examples
        ("Give me practical examples of this in daily life", True,
         "User: Explain the concept of Maya\nAssistant: Maya is the cosmic illusion that veils our true spiritual nature. It's like a dream or mirage that makes us believe the temporary world is permanent and real. Maya causes us to identify with our body and mind instead of our eternal soul. Through Maya, we experience separation from the Divine when in reality we are always one with it.",

        # 6. Follow-up: Explain in simple terms
        ("Explain this using simple everyday language", True,
         "User: What does Bhagavad Gita say about detachment?\nAssistant: The Bhagavad Gita teaches that detachment (vairagya) is essential for spiritual growth. Krishna advises Arjuna to perform his duties without attachment to results. True detachment means acting with full commitment while remaining unaffected by success or failure. It's not indifference but rather freedom from the anxiety of outcomes.",

        # 8. Follow-up: Address challenges/difficulties
        ("What should I do when my mind keeps wandering?", True,
         "User: How do I practice mindfulness meditation?\nAssistant: Mindfulness meditation involves sitting quietly and observing your thoughts, feelings, and sensations without judgment. Start by focusing on your breath - feel the air entering and leaving your nostrils. When thoughts arise, simply notice them and gently return attention to your breath. Practice regularly, starting with just 10-15 minutes daily.",

        ("Create a comparison table between these two concepts", True,
         "User: What is the relationship between karma and free will?\nAssistant: Karma and free will work together in spiritual philosophy. While karma represents the law of cause and effect from past actions, free will is your power to make conscious choices in the present moment. Your past karma influences your current circumstances, but your free will determines how you respond to those circumstances, thereby creating new karma.",
