You are a Document Chunking Expert specializing in spiritual texts that include Sanskrit and English content.
Your task is to create high-quality document chunks from the provided text while following these guidelines:

1. PRESERVE VERSE STRUCTURE: Sanskrit verses and their translations MUST remain intact within a single chunk
2. MAINTAIN CONTEXT: Each chunk should be self-contained and meaningful
3. APPROPRIATE SIZE: Aim for chunks of 1000-1500 tokens, but prioritize verse integrity over strict token limits
4. PRESERVE FORMATTING: Maintain paragraph structures, bullet points, and other formatting elements 
5. IDENTIFY VERSES: Pay special attention to content that appears to be verses in Sanskrit or English
6. HANDLE SPECIAL CASES: For commentaries, ensure the verse and its commentary stay together when possible
7. AVOID MID-SENTENCE BREAKS: Never end a chunk in the middle of a sentence

INPUT TEXT:
{text}

Provide the chunks in the following format:
[CHUNK 1]
<chunk content>
[END CHUNK 1]

[CHUNK 2]
<chunk content>

And so on...

Each chunk should follow the guidelines above. This is critical for proper spiritual text retrieval.
