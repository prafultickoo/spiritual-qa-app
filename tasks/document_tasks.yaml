    Process spiritual documents from the Documents directory. Extract text content and create
    meaningful chunks that maintain the integrity of Sanskrit and English verses.
    Each chunk should be of appropriate size for embeddings (typically 1000-1500 tokens),
    but should prioritize keeping verses intact rather than strict token limits.

  description: "Verify the quality and integrity of document chunks"
  expected_output: "Verification report on chunk quality and corrected chunks if needed"

  async_execution: false
  priority: 2
  context: >
    Review the chunks created by the chunking agent. Verify that verses are preserved intact,
    chunks have appropriate context, and the overall quality is suitable for efficient
    retrieval and question answering. Flag any issues and provide corrections if needed.
